# OHS Management Plan (OHSMP) Generation

## Context and Purpose

An Occupational Health and Safety Management Plan (OHSMP), also known as a Work Health and Safety Management Plan (WHSMP) or Health and Safety Management Plan (HSMP), is a comprehensive document that describes how health and safety will be managed throughout the project lifecycle. It demonstrates the contractor's commitment to safety and compliance with WHS legislation and project-specific safety requirements. This plan must be approved before site establishment and before any high-risk construction work commences so the principal contractor can demonstrate compliance at project kickoff.

The OHSMP serves multiple critical functions:

1. **Safety Compliance** - Demonstrates compliance with WHS legislation
2. **Hazard Management** - Identifies and controls workplace hazards
3. **Risk Control** - Establishes risk control measures using hierarchy of controls
4. **Incident Management** - Defines procedures for incidents and emergencies
5. **Worker Protection** - Ensures worker health, safety and wellbeing
6. **Stakeholder Safety** - Protects public and stakeholders from project risks

## Regulatory and Standards Context

### Work Health and Safety Legislation

The OHSMP must demonstrate compliance with:

- **Work Health and Safety Act 2011** (or state/territory equivalent)
- **Work Health and Safety Regulations 2011** (or state/territory equivalent)
- **Codes of Practice** - Applicable to work activities
- **Industry Standards** - Construction-specific safety standards

### Principal Contractor Duties

Under WHS legislation, the principal contractor must:

- Ensure coordination of work activities
- Consult with workers and other duty holders
- Provide information, training, instruction and supervision
- Implement control measures for risks
- Monitor effectiveness of control measures
- Ensure emergency procedures are in place

### ISO 45001:2018

The OHSMP should align with ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety Management System requirements:

- **Clause 4** - Context of the organization and OH&S management system
- **Clause 5** - Leadership and worker participation
- **Clause 6** - Planning for hazard identification and risk assessment
- **Clause 7** - Support (resources, competence, awareness, communication)
- **Clause 8** - Operational planning and control
- **Clause 9** - Performance evaluation and monitoring
- **Clause 10** - Improvement and corrective action

## Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment

### Common Construction Hazards

Identify and assess hazards including:

**Physical Hazards:**
- Slips, trips and falls
- Falls from height
- Being struck by moving objects or vehicles
- Being caught in or between objects
- Electrical contact
- Noise and vibration
- Heat and cold stress

**Chemical Hazards:**
- Hazardous substances (fuels, solvents, chemicals)
- Dust (silica, asbestos)
- Fumes and vapours
- Concrete and cement

**Biological Hazards:**
- Insect bites and stings
- Snake bites
- Disease transmission
- Contaminated soil or water

**Psychosocial Hazards:**
- Work-related stress
- Fatigue
- Workplace bullying
- Mental health impacts
- Isolation

**Ergonomic Hazards:**
- Manual handling
- Repetitive tasks
- Awkward postures
- Vibration exposure

### Risk Assessment Process

For each hazard, assess:

- Nature of the hazard
- Who could be harmed
- Likelihood of occurrence
- Consequence/severity
- Current controls
- Residual risk rating
- Additional controls required
- Responsibility for implementation

### Hierarchy of Controls

Apply controls in this order of effectiveness:

1. **Elimination** - Remove the hazard
2. **Substitution** - Replace with something safer
3. **Engineering Controls** - Isolate people from the hazard
4. **Administrative Controls** - Change the way people work
5. **PPE** - Protect the worker with equipment

## High-Risk Construction Work

Specific controls required for:

**Working at Heights:**
- Fall prevention measures
- Edge protection requirements
- Scaffold design and inspection
- Harness and anchor points
- Rescue procedures

**Confined Spaces:**
- Entry permits
- Atmospheric testing
- Ventilation requirements
- Emergency procedures
- Communication systems

**Excavation:**
- Service location procedures
- Benching and battering
- Shoring and support
- Edge protection
- Traffic management

**Plant and Equipment:**
- Pre-start inspections
- Operator competency
- Exclusion zones
- Traffic management
- Maintenance requirements

**Traffic Management:**
- Traffic control plans
- Traffic controllers
- Signage and delineation
- Speed limits
- Vehicle/pedestrian separation

## QSE System Integration

Position the OHSMP alongside the PQP and EMP so safety controls, inductions and SWMS link back to corporate QSE dashboards and contract deliverable registers.

The OHSMP should leverage existing corporate QSE system procedures where available:

- Reference corporate safety procedures
- Link to corporate safety policies
- Cross-reference corporate SWMS
- Cross-reference corporate training materials
- Indicate which procedures are project-specific vs corporate

## Content Requirements

### Exhaustive and Implementable
- Be highly detailed across ALL safety sections
- Expand major sections into multiple detailed control measures
- Prefer specificity grounded in project documents and site conditions
- Provide best-practice controls for all identified hazards
- Mark assumptions clearly

### Detailed Section Content

For each hazard/activity include:
- Description of the hazard/activity
- Who could be harmed and how
- Legislative requirements
- Applicable standards and codes of practice
- Risk assessment (likelihood × consequence)
- Control measures (hierarchy of controls)
- Competency and training requirements
- Supervision requirements
- Inspection and monitoring
- Emergency procedures
- Records to be maintained

### Matrices and Tables

Provide matrices/tables including:
- Hazard and risk register
- Risk assessment matrix
- Control measures summary
- High-risk work activities list
- Inspection schedules
- Training requirements matrix
- Roles and responsibilities (RACI)
- Emergency contacts
- Safety KPIs with targets

Represent each matrix or table as DocumentSection body text (for example, pipe-delimited Markdown) rather than HTML so the data persists directly in nodes.

## Task Instructions

You are tasked with generating a comprehensive OHSMP based on project documentation:

1. **Get the projectId** - Query the Generated Database (port 7690) to get the Project node and its `projectId`:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (p:Project) RETURN p.projectId
   ```
   This UUID must be included in the ManagementPlan entity you create.

2. **Query the Project Docs Database** (port 7688) to access:
   - Contract safety requirements
   - Scope of works
   - Construction methodology
   - Site constraints
   - Specifications

3. **Query the IMS/QSE Database** (port 7689) to find corporate content:
   - Search for safety procedures, SWMS templates, and forms
   - Find approved safety management procedures
   - Identify applicable safety registers
   - Reference existing corporate procedures instead of duplicating
   - See `ims-integration-guide.md` for detailed integration instructions

4. **Query the Standards Database** (port 7687) to understand:
   - Jurisdiction-specific safety requirements
   - Applicable codes of practice
   - Industry safety standards

5. **Analyze documentation** to determine:
   - Project-specific hazards
   - High-risk construction work
   - Site-specific risks
   - Safety critical activities
   - Emergency response requirements

6. **Structure the OHSMP** according to jurisdictional template:
   - Use VIC template (Section 168A) for Victoria projects
   - Use WA template (Spec 203) for Western Australia projects
   - Use Generic template if no specific jurisdiction applies

7. **Integrate corporate IMS/QSE content** by:
   - For each section, query IMS database (port 7689) for relevant safety procedures
   - Reference existing corporate procedures with links (e.g., `[Incident Management Procedure](https://projectpro.pro/ims/safety/incident-management)`)
   - Link to corporate SWMS templates where applicable
   - Only write project-specific content where no corporate equivalent exists
   - Clearly separate corporate references from project-specific requirements
   - Store IMS references in DocumentSection `imsReferences` property
   - See `ims-integration-guide.md` for detailed patterns and examples

8. **Write output** to the **Generated Database** (port 7690)

9. Create the `ManagementPlan` node with `type` = 'OHSMP', populated `projectId`, `title`, `version`, `approvalStatus`, optional `summary`/`notes`, optional `requiredItps`, plus `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps.

10. For each section, create a `DocumentSection` node (`containerType` = 'ManagementPlan') with `projectId`, `level`, `orderIndex`, `heading`, and `body` plain text, linking to the plan via `[:HAS_SECTION]` and using `[:HAS_SUBSECTION]` for nested structure, and set timestamps and `[:BELONGS_TO_PROJECT]`.

## Naming Convention

**CRITICAL**: All field names MUST use camelCase (e.g., `projectId`, `docNo`, `workType`, `revisionDate`).

- NOT snake_case (project_id, doc_no)

- NOT PascalCase (ProjectId, DocNo)

- Use camelCase consistently throughout

## Output Format

Your output must conform to the Management Plan schema defined in `AGENT_SCHEMA.md`. Follow the instructions in `Writing to Generated DB.md` exactly.

### OHSMP-Specific Requirements

**ManagementPlan Node:**
- Use `MERGE` with `{projectId: 'xxx', type: 'OHSMP'}` as the unique key
- Required properties: `type: 'OHSMP'`, `title`, `version`, `approvalStatus`, `projectId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
- Optional properties: `summary`, `notes`
- If safety ITPs are required, store as JSON string: `requiredItps: '[{"docNo": "ITP-SAFE-01", "workType": "High Risk Work", "mandatory": true}]'`

**DocumentSection Nodes:**
- Use `CREATE` for sections (they are unique children of the plan)
- Required properties per schema:
  - `projectId` (string)
  - `sectionId` (unique identifier, e.g., 'OHSMP-SEC-1')
  - `title` (NOT `heading`) - the section heading text
  - `sectionNumber` (NOT `headingNumber`) - e.g., '1.0', '1.1'
  - `order` (NOT `orderIndex`) - integer for sorting
  - `content` (NOT `body`) - the section content/text (HTML or Markdown)
  - `createdAt`, `updatedAt` (datetime)
- Optional properties: `level`, `imsReferences` (array of strings - simple array is OK)
  - Example: `imsReferences: ['QSE-9.1-PROC-01', 'QSE-8.2-FORM-01']`

**SWMS Nodes (if creating Safe Work Method Statements):**
- Use `MERGE` with `{projectId: 'xxx', swmsId: 'SWMS-001'}` as the unique key
- Required properties: `swmsId`, `title`, `activity`, `project`, `projectId`, `content`, `status`, `version`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
- Link via `(:ManagementPlan)-[:INCLUDES_SWMS]->(:SWMS)`

**Relationships:**
- `(:ManagementPlan)-[:HAS_SECTION]->(:DocumentSection)` for all top-level sections
- `(:DocumentSection)-[:HAS_SUBSECTION]->(:DocumentSection)` for nested sections (if applicable)
- `(:ManagementPlan)-[:BELONGS_TO_PROJECT]->(:Project)`
- `(:ManagementPlan)-[:INCLUDES_SWMS]->(:SWMS)` for SWMS documents

**IMS Integration:**
- Store IMS/QSE references in `imsReferences` array property on DocumentSection nodes
- Example: `imsReferences: ['QSE-9.1-PROC-01', 'QSE-8.2-FORM-01']`
- Reference these in the section content with links to the corporate procedures

All output must be written to the Generated Database (port 7690) via a single `.cypher` file as per `Writing to Generated DB.md`.

## Complete Cypher Example with Detailed Safety Content

**CRITICAL:** This example demonstrates the level of detail required for EVERY section. Each section must have multiple paragraphs, tables, procedures, and specific project details - NOT just one-sentence stubs.

```cypher
// Example OHSMP with COMPREHENSIVE, DETAILED safety sections using APOC
CALL apoc.cypher.runMany('
// Step 1: Create/update project
MERGE (p:Project {projectId: "example-project-789"})
SET p.projectName = "Example Road Reconstruction", 
    p.updatedAt = datetime();

// Step 2: Create/update management plan
MATCH (p:Project {projectId: "example-project-789"})
MERGE (mp:ManagementPlan {projectId: p.projectId, type: "OHSMP"})
ON CREATE SET mp.createdAt = datetime()
SET mp.title = "Occupational Health and Safety Management Plan - Example Road Reconstruction",
    mp.version = "1.0",
    mp.approvalStatus = "draft",
    mp.summary = "Comprehensive OHSMP addressing high-risk construction work including traffic management, excavation, plant operations, working at heights, and manual handling for urban road reconstruction.",
    mp.notes = "Integrates corporate WHS procedures. Key risks: traffic strike, excavation collapse, plant interaction, asphalt burns, noise exposure, manual handling injuries.",
    mp.requiredItps = "[{\"docNo\":\"ITP-SAFE-01\",\"workType\":\"High Risk Construction Work\",\"mandatory\":true},{\"docNo\":\"ITP-SAFE-02\",\"workType\":\"Excavation and Trenching\",\"mandatory\":true}]",
    mp.updatedAt = datetime()
MERGE (mp)-[:BELONGS_TO_PROJECT]->(p);

// Step 3: Section on Traffic Management Safety - DETAILED EXAMPLE
MATCH (mp:ManagementPlan {projectId: "example-project-789", type: "OHSMP"})
