# OHS Management Plan (OHSMP) Generation

## Context and Purpose

An Occupational Health and Safety Management Plan (OHSMP), also known as a Work Health and Safety Management Plan (WHSMP) or Health and Safety Management Plan (HSMP), is a comprehensive document that describes how health and safety will be managed throughout the project lifecycle. It demonstrates the contractor's commitment to safety and compliance with WHS legislation and project-specific safety requirements.

The OHSMP serves multiple critical functions:

1. **Safety Compliance** - Demonstrates compliance with WHS legislation
2. **Hazard Management** - Identifies and controls workplace hazards
3. **Risk Control** - Establishes risk control measures using hierarchy of controls
4. **Incident Management** - Defines procedures for incidents and emergencies
5. **Worker Protection** - Ensures worker health, safety and wellbeing
6. **Stakeholder Safety** - Protects public and stakeholders from project risks

## Regulatory and Standards Context

### Work Health and Safety Legislation

The OHSMP must demonstrate compliance with:

- **Work Health and Safety Act 2011** (or state/territory equivalent)
- **Work Health and Safety Regulations 2011** (or state/territory equivalent)
- **Codes of Practice** - Applicable to work activities
- **Industry Standards** - Construction-specific safety standards

### Principal Contractor Duties

Under WHS legislation, the principal contractor must:

- Ensure coordination of work activities
- Consult with workers and other duty holders
- Provide information, training, instruction and supervision
- Implement control measures for risks
- Monitor effectiveness of control measures
- Ensure emergency procedures are in place

### ISO 45001:2018

The OHSMP should align with ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety Management System requirements:

- **Clause 4** - Context of the organization and OH&S management system
- **Clause 5** - Leadership and worker participation
- **Clause 6** - Planning for hazard identification and risk assessment
- **Clause 7** - Support (resources, competence, awareness, communication)
- **Clause 8** - Operational planning and control
- **Clause 9** - Performance evaluation and monitoring
- **Clause 10** - Improvement and corrective action

## Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment

### Common Construction Hazards

Identify and assess hazards including:

**Physical Hazards:**
- Slips, trips and falls
- Falls from height
- Being struck by moving objects or vehicles
- Being caught in or between objects
- Electrical contact
- Noise and vibration
- Heat and cold stress

**Chemical Hazards:**
- Hazardous substances (fuels, solvents, chemicals)
- Dust (silica, asbestos)
- Fumes and vapours
- Concrete and cement

**Biological Hazards:**
- Insect bites and stings
- Snake bites
- Disease transmission
- Contaminated soil or water

**Psychosocial Hazards:**
- Work-related stress
- Fatigue
- Workplace bullying
- Mental health impacts
- Isolation

**Ergonomic Hazards:**

### Risk Assessment Process

For each hazard, assess:

- Nature of the hazard
- Who could be harmed
- Likelihood of occurrence
- Consequence/severity
- Current controls
- Residual risk rating
- Additional controls required
- Responsibility for implementation

### Hierarchy of Controls

Apply controls in this order of effectiveness:

1. **Elimination** - Remove the hazard
2. **Substitution** - Replace with something safer
3. **Engineering Controls** - Isolate people from the hazard
4. **Administrative Controls** - Change the way people work
5. **PPE** - Protect the worker with equipment

## High-Risk Construction Work

- Competency and training requirements
- Supervision requirements
- Inspection and monitoring
- Emergency procedures
- Records to be maintained

### Matrices and Tables

## Task Instructions

You are tasked with generating a comprehensive OHSMP based on project documentation:

1. **Get the project_uuid** - Query the Generated Database (port 7690) to get the Project node and its `project_uuid`:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (p:Project) RETURN p.project_uuid
   ```
   This UUID must be included in the ManagementPlan entity you create.

2. **Query the Project Docs Database** (port 7688) to access:
   - Contract safety requirements
   - Scope of works
   - Construction methodology
   - Site constraints
   - Specifications

2. **Query the Standards Database** (port 7687) to understand:
   - Jurisdiction-specific safety requirements
   - Applicable codes of practice
   - Industry safety standards

3. **Analyze documentation** to determine:
   - Project-specific hazards
   - High-risk construction work
   - Site-specific risks
   - Safety critical activities
   - Emergency response requirements

4. **Structure the OHSMP** according to jurisdictional template:
   - Use VIC template (Section 168A) for Victoria projects
   - Use WA template for Western Australia projects
   - Use Generic template if no specific jurisdiction applies

5. **Integrate corporate QSE content** by:
   - Referencing existing corporate safety procedures
   - Linking to corporate SWMS
   - Creating project-specific content for site-specific hazards
   - Maintaining links to QSE system items

6. **Write output** to the **Generated Database** (port 7690)

## Output Format

Your output must conform to the Management Plan schema. See the output schema file copied to your workspace for the exact structure including:

- Plan metadata (title, revision, jurisdiction, standards)
- Section structure (hierarchical using parentId)
- Content blocks (text, bullets, numbered, table, note, link)
- QSE system references (as links)
- Cypher CREATE statement format

All output must be written directly to the Generated Database (port 7690) as Neo4j graph nodes using Cypher queries.
