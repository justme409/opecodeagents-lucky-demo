<p>This procedure explains how [Company Name] identifies, evaluates, and maintains compliance obligations affecting quality, environmental, and occupational health &amp; safety operations in accordance with ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and ISO 45001.</p>
<h2>1. Purpose</h2>
<p>Ensure all legal and other requirements are captured in the Compliance Obligations Register (QSE-6.1-REG-03), communicated to affected teams, and integrated into project and corporate processes.</p>
<h2>2. Scope</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Legislation and regulations across Commonwealth, State, and Local jurisdictions.</li>
  <li>Permits, licences, authority approvals, and environmental consents.</li>
  <li>Mandatory Australian/International Standards referenced in contracts.</li>
  <li>Client-specific contractual obligations and technical specifications.</li>
  <li>Industry codes, voluntary commitments, and corporate policies.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Identification &amp; Access</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sources:</strong> Legal update services, regulator bulletins, industry associations, contract reviews, and project jurisdiction packs.</li>
  <li><strong>Capture:</strong> QSE Manager enters each obligation into QSE-6.1-REG-03 with scope, applicability, controls, and reference links. Project-level obligations are linked to `/app/projects/[projectId]/quality/records` or plan modules.</li>
  <li><strong>Review Cycle:</strong> Quarterly checkpoint to verify accuracy and currency; immediate updates when triggers occur (new legislation, contract award, regulator notice).</li>
</ol>
<h2>4. Evaluation of Compliance</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Departments assess compliance status and evidence. Results are recorded in the register with status flags (Compliant, Partial, Non-compliant).</li>
  <li>Non-compliances trigger corrective actions in QSE-10.3-REG-01 and, if required, NCR workflows.</li>
  <li>Summary provided to Management Review as mandated input.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Change Management</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Impact Assessment:</strong> Determine affected procedures, plans, projects, and assets.</li>
  <li><strong>Gap Analysis:</strong> Compare existing controls to new requirements; document gaps.</li>
  <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Assign actions with deadlines, update procedures/templates, and coordinate training via competence modules.</li>
  <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Notify impacted personnel using the in-app communication tools and ensure acknowledgements are captured.</li>
  <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Conduct audits or inspections to confirm implementation effectiveness and close actions.</li>
</ol>
<h2>6. Records &amp; Traceability</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Compliance Obligations Register (QSE-6.1-REG-03) is the controlled source.</li>
  <li>Action plans, training records, and communications are stored in respective modules with links to the obligation entry.</li>
  <li>Processing runs capturing AI-assisted analysis are linked via OUTPUT_OF edges for provenance.</li>
</ul>
